# Classification System v1.3 - Complete Fix Summary

## Overview

Version 1.3 addresses **two critical classification issues**:

1. **Ohmic devices misclassified as Memristive** (v1.2 fix)
2. **Memristive devices misclassified as Memcapacitive** (v1.3 fix)

---

## Issue #1: Ohmic → Memristive False Positives (FIXED in v1.2)

### Problem
Linear resistive devices with tiny hysteresis artifacts were classified as memristive.

**Example**:
```
Device: 10-FS-1.5v-0.05sv-0.05sd-Py-St_v2-.txt
OLD: Memristive (35%) ← Wrong!
Features: Linear, No switching, Tiny artifact

NEW: Ohmic (60-70%) ← Fixed! ✓
```

### Solution
- Graduated ohmic scoring (4 quality levels)
- Critical penalty for hysteresis without switching (-40 pts)
- Artifact detection for linear+pinched+no_switching cases
- Enhanced pinched hysteresis validation

**See**: `OHMIC_CLASSIFICATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`

---

## Issue #2: Memristive → Memcapacitive False Positives (FIXED in v1.3)

### Problem
Devices with switching behavior were classified as memcapacitive when they didn't pass exactly through zero.

**Example**:
```
Device: 11-FS-2.5v-0.05sv-0.05sd-Py-St_v1-3.txt
OLD: Memcapacitive (50%) ← Wrong!
Features: Switching YES, Nonlinear YES, No zero crossing

NEW: Memristive (65-85%) ← Fixed! ✓
```

### Solution
- **Switching + Nonlinearity Bonus** (+20 pts) - THE memristive signature
- **Memcapacitive Strong Switching Penalty** (-25 pts) - prevents competition
- **Adaptive Area Thresholds** - scale with current (1nA to 1mA)
- **Relaxed Pinched Check** - 10% for switching devices (was 5%)

**See**: `MEMRISTIVE_VS_MEMCAPACITIVE_FIX.md`

---

## Key Improvements (v1.3)

### 1. **Switching is King** 👑
```python
if switching AND nonlinear:
    memristive_score += 20  # Bonus - THE memristive signature
```

**Why**: Switching (state-dependent resistance) is THE defining characteristic of a memristor. More important than pinched loop or hysteresis area.

### 2. **Adaptive Thresholds** 📐
```python
# Scale with current magnitude
current_scale = sqrt(max_current / 1mA)
threshold = base_threshold * current_scale
```

**Why**: Fixed threshold (1e-4) doesn't work for devices with currents ranging from 1e-9 to 1e-3 A.

### 3. **Real-World Tolerance** 🔧
```python
if has_strong_switching:
    pinch_threshold = 0.10  # 10% relaxed (was 5%)
```

**Why**: Real memristors don't always pass exactly through zero due to series resistance, contact effects, measurement offsets.

### 4. **No More Competition** 🚫
```python
if strong_switching (ON/OFF > 2):
    memcapacitive_score -= 25  # Penalty
```

**Why**: Strong switching is distinctly memristive. Memcapacitors can have weak switching but not strong state changes.

## Quick Reference: Classification Logic

### Memristive Classification
**Requirements** (any combination):
1. ⭐ **Switching + Nonlinear** → 65 pts (25 + 10 + 20 bonus) ← **Primary path**
2. Hysteresis + Pinched → 55 pts (25 + 30)
3. All features → 120 pts max

**Penalties**:
- Linear I-V: -20
- Ohmic behavior: -30
- Hysteresis without switching: -40

**Result**: Switching devices now dominate!

### Memcapacitive Classification
**Requirements**:
- Unpinched hysteresis + Weak switching (ON/OFF < 2)
- Phase shift > 30°

**Penalties**:
- Strong switching (ON/OFF > 2): -25 ← **NEW**
- Pinched hysteresis: -20

**Result**: Can't compete with memristive when switching present!

### Ohmic Classification
**4 Quality Levels**:
1. **Strong** (80 pts): Linear + Ohmic behavior + No hysteresis
2. **Clear** (70 pts): Linear + No hysteresis
3. **With Artifact** (60 pts): Linear + Weak hysteresis artifact
4. **Weak** (40 pts): Linear + Some hysteresis

**Penalties**:
- Strong hysteresis + switching: -30
- Nonlinearity: -20

**Result**: Properly handles artifacts!

## Testing Your Devices

### Test Script
```python
from analysis.core.sweep_analyzer import SweepAnalyzer
import numpy as np

def test_classification(file_path):
    data = np.loadtxt(file_path, skiprows=1)
    voltage = data[:, 0]
    current = data[:, 1]
    
    analyzer = SweepAnalyzer(voltage, current, analysis_level='classification')
    
    print(f"File: {file_path}")
    print(f"Classification: {analyzer.device_type} ({analyzer.classification_confidence:.1%})")
    print(f"\nScores:")
    for dtype, score in sorted(analyzer.classification_breakdown.items(), 
                               key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):

    if analyzer.on_off:
        print(f"\nON/OFF Ratio: {np.mean(analyzer.on_off):.2f}")
    
    print("\n" + "="*60)

# Test your problem devices
test_classification("10-FS-1.5v-0.05sv-0.05sd-Py-St_v2-.txt")  # Should be Ohmic
test_classification("11-FS-2.5v-0.05sv-0.05sd-Py-St_v1-3.txt")  # Should be Memristive
```
