# Memcapacitive Double Zero Crossing Fix (v1.4)

## Critical Discovery

**User Insight**: "Isn't memcapacitive supposed to have TWO cross points through zero?"

**Answer**: **YES! Absolutely correct!** This is a fundamental distinction that was implemented incorrectly.

---

## The Fundamental Difference

### **Memristive Device** (Resistance-based memory)
```
I-V Characteristic: SINGLE pinched crossing at origin
Pattern: Figure-8 or butterfly with lobes meeting at (0,0)

    I
    ^
    |    /\
    |   /  \     One crossing
    |  /    \    at origin
  --+---------> V
    |    /
    | __/
```

**Physics**: `dφ/dt = V`, `M = dφ/dq`  
**Signature**: State-dependent resistance, ONE zero crossing

### **Memcapacitive Device** (Charge-based memory)
```
I-V Characteristic: DOUBLE zero crossing per cycle
Pattern: Horizontal figure-8 or butterfly

    I
    ^
    |   ___
    |  /   \___      Two distinct
 ---|--/-------\---> V  crossings!
    |  \___   /
    |      \_/
```

**Physics**: `dq/dt = I`, `C = dq/dV`  
**Signature**: Charge-dependent capacitance, TWO zero crossings

## Problem with Old Logic

### **Old (WRONG) Implementation**:
```python
if has_hysteresis and NOT pinched:
    memcapacitive_score += 40  # WRONG!
```

**Issue**: This classifies ANY unpinched hysteresis as memcapacitive, which is incorrect!

**Counterexamples**:
- Capacitors (unpinched, but NOT memcapacitive)
- Diodes (unpinched, but NOT memcapacitive)  
- Inductors (unpinched, but NOT memcapacitive)

### **Your Device** (`11-FS-2.5v-0.05sv-0.05sd-Py-St_v1-3.txt`):
- Passes "damn close" to zero → **ONE crossing** ✓
- Switching behavior + Nonlinearity ✓
- **Classification**: Should be **Memristive**, NOT Memcapacitive!

---

## New (CORRECT) Implementation (v1.4)

### 1. **Double Zero Crossing Detection**

New function: `_check_double_zero_crossing()`

```python
def _check_double_zero_crossing(self):
    """
    Detect DOUBLE zero crossing (memcapacitive fingerprint).
    TWO distinct crossings through zero per cycle.
    """
    # Find where current changes sign
    zero_crossings = []
    for i in range(1, len(self.current)):
        if self.current[i-1] * self.current[i] < 0:  # Sign change
            zero_crossings.append(i)
    
    # Group nearby crossings into regions
    crossing_regions = group_crossings(zero_crossings)
    
    # Memcapacitive: 3+ regions (double crossing)
    # Memristive: 1-2 regions (single pinch)
    return len(crossing_regions) >= 3
```

**Logic**:
- For one full bipolar sweep (0 → +V → 0 → -V → 0):
  - **Memristive**: 1-2 crossing regions (pinched at origin)
  - **Memcapacitive**: 3-4 crossing regions (double crossing)

### 2. **Corrected Memcapacitive Scoring**

```python
# PRIMARY SIGNATURE: Double zero crossing
if double_zero_crossing:
    memcapacitive_score += 50  # THE memcapacitive fingerprint

# PENALTY: Single pinch is memristive, NOT memcapacitive!
if pinched_hysteresis:
    memcapacitive_score -= 30  # (increased from -20)

# LEGACY: Unpinched hysteresis (de-emphasized)
# Only if NO double crossing detected
if unpinched_hysteresis and NOT double_zero_crossing:
    memcapacitive_score += 20  # (reduced from 40)
```

## Classification Logic (v1.4)

### **Memristive Path**
| Feature | Score | Logic |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Pinched Hysteresis** | +30 | ONE crossing at origin |
| **Switching + Nonlinear** | +45 | 25 + 10 + 20 bonus |
| Hysteresis | +25 | Loop present |
| Polarity Dependent | +10 | Bipolar switching |
| **Total (Strong Memristive)** | **110** | All features |

**Key**: Single pinched crossing + switching

### **Memcapacitive Path**
| Feature | Score | Logic |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Double Zero Crossing** | +50 | TWO crossings (PRIMARY) |
| Phase Shift > 30° | +20 | Capacitive component |
| Weak Switching (< 2) | +30 | Charge-state dependent |
| Elliptical Pattern | +15 | Butterfly shape |
| Nonlinear | +20 | State-dependent C |
| **Total (Strong Memcapacitive)** | **135** | All features |
| **PENALTY: Pinched** | **-30** | Single crossing = memristive! |
| **PENALTY: Strong Switching** | **-25** | ON/OFF > 2 = memristive! |

**Key**: Double crossing + capacitive behavior

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Test Case 1: Your Device (Memristive with near-zero crossing)

**Device**: `11-FS-2.5v-0.05sv-0.05sd-Py-St_v1-3.txt`

**Before (v1.3)**:
```
Memcapacitive: 50% ❌
  - Unpinched hysteresis: +40
  - Switching: +30 - 25 (penalty) = +5

Memristive: 45%
  - Switching + Nonlinear: +35
  - No pinched (close but not perfect): 0
```

**After (v1.4)**:
```
Memristive: 65-85% ✅
  - Switching + Nonlinear: +45 (with bonus)
  - Pinched: +30 (relaxed 10% threshold passes)
  - Total: 75-85

Memcapacitive: 5-20%
  - NO double crossing: 0
  - Pinched penalty: -30
  - Switching penalty: -25
  - Total: -55 + (legacy unpinched if detected: +20) = -35 to -15
```

**Result**: Correctly classified as **Memristive**!

### Test Case 2: True Memcapacitor (Double crossing)

**Hypothetical device with double zero crossing**:

**After (v1.4)**:
```
Memcapacitive: 85% ✅
  - Double zero crossing: +50
  - Phase shift: +20
  - Elliptical: +15
  - Total: 85

Memristive: 25-35%
  - NO pinched (double crossing ≠ pinched): 0
  - Weak switching might add: +25
  - Total: 25-35
```

**Result**: Correctly classified as **Memcapacitive**!

### Test Case 3: Pure Capacitor (Unpinched, no double crossing)

**After (v1.4)**:
```
Capacitive: 60% ✅
  - Unpinched hysteresis: +40
  - Phase shift > 45°: +40
  - Elliptical: +20
  - Total: 100 (but capped by confidence)

Memcapacitive: 20%
  - NO double crossing: 0
  - Legacy unpinched: +20
  - NO switching/nonlinearity: 0
  - Total: 20
```

**Result**: Correctly classified as **Capacitive** (not memcapacitive)!

## Physical Basis

### Why One vs Two Crossings?

**Memristive** (Resistance memory):
```
Ohm's Law: V = R·I
If R depends on state (history), you get hysteresis
But at V = 0: I = R·0 = 0 (always!)
→ MUST pass through origin
→ ONE crossing point
```

**Memcapacitive** (Charge memory):
```
Capacitor: I = C·dV/dt
If C depends on charge (history), you get hysteresis
At V = 0: I can be ≠ 0 during charging/discharging
→ Can cross zero at different V values
→ TWO crossing points (charge/discharge cycles)
```

---

## Diagnostic Features

### Check if device is memcapacitive:

1. **Count zero crossings** in one full cycle:
   - 1-2 regions → Memristive or Ohmic
   - 3+ regions → Memcapacitive candidate

2. **Check phase shift**:
   - < 20° → Resistive behavior
   - 20-45° → Mixed behavior
   - > 45° → Capacitive behavior

3. **Look for butterfly pattern**:
   - Vertical figure-8 → Memristive
   - Horizontal figure-8 → Memcapacitive
   - Elliptical → Capacitive

4. **Analyze switching**:
   - Strong (ON/OFF > 2) → Memristive
   - Weak (ON/OFF < 2) → Could be memcapacitive
   - None → Capacitive or ohmic

---

## Testing

### Visual Inspection

Plot your I-V curve and count zero crossings:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load data
data = np.loadtxt("your_file.txt", skiprows=1)
voltage = data[:, 0]
current = data[:, 1]

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(voltage, current*1e6, 'b-', linewidth=2)
plt.axhline(y=0, color='k', linestyle='--', alpha=0.3)
plt.axvline(x=0, color='k', linestyle='--', alpha=0.3)
plt.xlabel('Voltage (V)')
plt.ylabel('Current (μA)')
plt.title('I-V Characteristic - Count Zero Crossings')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.show()

# Count crossings manually:
# - If curve crosses I=0 line ONCE → Memristive
# - If curve crosses I=0 line TWICE → Memcapacitive
```

### Automated Check

```python
from analysis.core.sweep_analyzer import SweepAnalyzer

analyzer = SweepAnalyzer(voltage, current, analysis_level='classification')

print(f"Device Type: {analyzer.device_type}")
print(f"Confidence: {analyzer.classification_confidence:.1%}")
print(f"\nFeatures:")
print(f"  Pinched (1 crossing): {analyzer.classification_features['pinched_hysteresis']}")
print(f"  Double crossing (2): {analyzer.classification_features.get('double_zero_crossing', False)}")
print(f"  Switching: {analyzer.classification_features['switching_behavior']}")
print(f"  Phase shift: {analyzer.classification_features['phase_shift']:.1f}°")
```

### Key Distinctions
- **Memristor**: `M(q) = dφ/dq` → **1 zero crossing**
- **Memcapacitor**: `C(q) = dq/dV` → **2 zero crossings**
- **Meminductor**: `L(φ) = dφ/dI` → **2 zero crossings** (current-flux)

## Next Steps

1. **Test on your full dataset** to verify the fix works universally
2. **Visualize I-V curves** for devices classified as memcapacitive - verify they have 2 crossings
3. **Report any edge cases** where classification seems wrong
4. **Consider adding** memind
uctor detection if you have L-I data

## Questions?

**Q: My device passes close to zero but isn't exactly zero. Is it memristive?**  
A: YES! v1.4 uses 10% threshold for switching devices. "Damn close" = memristive ✓

**Q: I have unpinched hysteresis. Is it memcapacitive?**  
A: Not necessarily! Check for DOUBLE zero crossing. Could be capacitive, inductive, or diode.

**Q: How do I know if I have double zero crossing?**  
A: Plot I-V curve. Count how many times the curve crosses the horizontal axis (I=0). Two times = memcapacitive.

**Q: Can I adjust the crossing detection threshold?**  
A: Yes, but carefully. The algorithm uses 5% of data length to group nearby crossings. This is tunable in the code.
