# Quick Fix Summary: Ohmic Classification Improvements

## Problem
Ohmic (linear resistive) devices were being misclassified as memristive when they had tiny hysteresis artifacts from measurement noise.

**Example**: Device with linear I-V, no switching, but tiny artifact → Classified as "Memristive (35%)" instead of "Ohmic"

## Solution Applied (v1.2)

### 5 Key Changes

#### 1. **Graduated Ohmic Scoring** (4 Quality Levels)
   - **Strong Ohmic** (80 pts): Perfect linear resistor
   - **Clear Ohmic** (70 pts): Clean linear behavior
   - **Ohmic with Artifact** (60 pts): Linear but with tiny hysteresis artifact ← **Fixes your case!**
   - **Weak Ohmic** (40 pts): Mostly linear

#### 2. **Critical Memristive Penalty** (-40 pts)
   - Applied when: Device has hysteresis BUT no switching behavior
   - Reasoning: True memristors MUST show switching. Without it → not memristive!

#### 3. **Artifact Detection Logic**
   - If device is: Linear + Pinched + No Switching → Artifact detected
   - Action: Disable pinched hysteresis credit, mark as artifact

#### 4. **Enhanced Pinched Hysteresis Check**
   - Requires minimum area (1e-4) to prevent false positives
   - Prevents tiny artifacts from being classified as pinched loops

#### 5. **Multi-Level Hysteresis Thresholds**
   - < 1e-4: Noise → False
   - 1e-4 to 1e-3: Borderline → Check consistency
   - > 1e-3: Real hysteresis → True

## Expected Result for Your Device

**Before**:
```
Device: 10-FS-1.5v-0.05sv-0.05sd-Py-St_v2-.txt
Predicted: Memristive (35.0%)

Scores:
  Memristive: 35.0  ← Wrong!
  Ohmic: 0.0        ← Should win!
  
Features:
  Hysteresis: YES     (artifact)
  Pinched Loop: YES   (false positive)
  Switching: no       ← Critical missing!
  Nonlinear I-V: no   ← Linear device!
```

**After (v1.2)**:
```
Device: 10-FS-1.5v-0.05sv-0.05sd-Py-St_v2-.txt
Predicted: Ohmic (60-70%)  ← Fixed! ✓

Scores:
  Ohmic: 60-70      ← Winner! ✓
  Memristive: -5    ← Penalized for no switching ✓
  
Features:
  Hysteresis: YES (artifact detected)  ← Marked as artifact ✓
  Pinched Loop: no  ← Disabled by artifact filter ✓
  Switching: no
  Nonlinear I-V: no
  Linear I-V: YES   ← Key feature recognized ✓
```

## Quick Test

```bash
# Test with your data
cd analysis/docs
python test_ohmic_classification.py path/to/your/data.txt

# Or run simulation test
python test_ohmic_classification.py --simulate
```

## Configuration (Optional)

All weights are in `Json_Files/classification_weights.json`:

```json
{
    "memristive_penalty_no_switching": -40.0,  // NEW: Critical penalty
    "ohmic_with_artifact": 60.0,               // NEW: Handles your case
    "ohmic_strong": 80.0,                      // NEW: Perfect ohmic
    "ohmic_clear": 70.0,                       // NEW: Clean ohmic
    "ohmic_weak": 40.0                         // NEW: Marginal ohmic
}
```

If still misclassifying, increase `ohmic_with_artifact` to 70 or 80.

## Files Changed

1. **`analysis/core/sweep_analyzer.py`**
   - Enhanced classification logic
   - Added artifact detection
   - Implemented graduated ohmic scoring

2. **`Json_Files/classification_weights.json`**
   - Added new weights (v1.2)

## Documentation

- **Full Details**: `OHMIC_CLASSIFICATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`
- **Test Script**: `test_ohmic_classification.py`
- **This File**: `QUICK_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

## Still Having Issues?

1. Check normalized hysteresis area in your data
   - If > 1e-3, it might actually be real hysteresis
   
2. Verify ON/OFF ratio < 1.5 (should be close to 1.0 for ohmic)

3. Enable debug mode:
   ```python
   # In sweep_analyzer.py, line 17:
   DEBUG_ENABLED = True
   ```

4. Adjust weights in `classification_weights.json` if needed
